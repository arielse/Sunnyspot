# Sunny Spot Project
The Sunny Spot website was created as part of a TAFE project. It is the amalgamation of all the skills learnt in my course.
The back-end was created using PHP with a MySQL database, managed using phpMyAdmin. The front-end was created using HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript and jQuery.

The site's Home page was given as a .PSD which was then coded to specification. All other pages on the site were designed by
me and had to fit into the given aesthetic provided in the Home page.

This website consists of a public section and an admin section that is accessible to admin staff using a login. Again, the 
administration pages were designed and coded by me.

The site contains: 
* A Home page
* Accommodation page
* Various other "information" pages
* Administration login
* Administration dashboard
* Forms to insert, delete, and update "Cabins"
